# pancakeswap-trailing-stop-loss-bot
A pancakeswap trading bot with trailing stop loss feature. Use at your own risk. Investing in cryptocurrency is risky. This is not financial advice. There is a small 0.7% buying fee per buy. This is to help me buy a cup of coffee and support for this project. 
## Getting Started
First, if you don't have node.js installed go to nodejs.org and install the lastest LTS version.
Then Use the following commands either in VScode or command prompt 
```
git clone https://github.com/Scott-778/pancakeswap-trailing-stop-loss-bot.git
```
```
cd pancakeswap-trailing-stop-loss-bot
```
```
npm install
```
Then edit .env file with your bsc wallet address, mnemonic in your code editor and save file.

To start bot run this command
```
node bot.js
```
